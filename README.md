## About the project
This is a game developed in parallel with the Digital Games Technology course at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie by two university colleagues: Nicolas Barbieri Sousa and Lucas Silvério da Silva. The goal of the project is to develop skills in the areas of computer programming, digital illustration and level design, as well as gain experience with and knowledge about the video games engine Unity and its integration with applications - such as Photoshop, Visual Studio and Aseprite - and third-party packages - such as TextMesh Pro and A* Pathfinding Project. Ergo, the objective is to build a simple video game using well established and largely adopted game mechanics.

#### Nicolas Barbieri Sousa - Programmer
My passion for digital games and computing is the reason why I study Digital Games Technology at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie, where I have been studying especially software development in C# and JavaScript programming languages, as well as tools such as the Unity game engine. In addition to curricular studies, I have been deepening my knowledge about related technologies, such as digital modeling and design, HTML and CSS, and emerging ones, such as artificial intelligence and ray tracing. Part of the results of these studies can be found on GitHub, both in repositories of personal and guided practical projects.
